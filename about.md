Hi i'm Alex McRae!

I grew up in Grimsby, Ontario and attending Ridley College.
I currently attend UVic studying computer science with a minor in business.
I enjoy running, guitar and have recently taken up rock climbing!
The area I am currently studying heavily is graphics programming such as opengl, ray tracing, path tracing, etc.
I also have intrests in many other ascpects of computer science like web application and distributed system.
My favorite programming language is Rust, I think it provides a great way to do systems programming without having to deal with the messes that are C/C++.
