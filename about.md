Hi i'm Alex McRae!

I grew up in Grimsby, Ontario and attending Ridley College.

I currently attend UVic studying computer science with a minor in business.

I enjoy running, guitar and have recently taken up rock climbing!

The area I am currently studying heavily is graphics programming such as opengl, ray tracing, path tracing, etc. I also have intrests in many other ascpects of computer science like web applications, distributed systems, and programming languages.

My favorite programming language is Rust, I think it provides a great way to do systems programming without having to deal with the messes that are C/C++.
