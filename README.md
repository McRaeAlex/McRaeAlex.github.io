## Alexander McRae

A little bit about me:
I am a second year computer science co op student at the University of Victoria. I am from Grimsby, Ontario, which is a town near Niagara Falls. In my free time I enjoy running, coding, and learning in general. I am currently training for a marathon. My favorite programming language is Rust because it confuses me at times and I enjoy that. You can find me on Github, or on mozilla's irc as BearOfJade. 

## Projects
### Rusty Snake

Rusty Snake is a battle snake server written in rust. It uses rocket as its http framework and Serde to serialize and deserialize json. I created Rusty out of curiosity, being someone who has taught themselves Java in high school and python the summer before University I didn't understand what happens at lower levels. This is why I choose to pick up rust. Rust made me realize how much highlevel languages like python and java abstract for you. Another benefit from rust was that its fast and I think that this open up a bunch of options on the things I can do with this snake. At the current time I am planning to add machine learning, but due to the faster speeds I could run complex algorithms like a* in a fraction of the time compared to my past snakes and possibly run multiple algorithms and compare results.

`Why`: I wanted to learn rust and I needed a battle snake for next year

`What I learned`: I learned rust and rocket as well as a lot of lower level stuff like the difficulties of memory management, and the stack vs the heap.

`Future plans`: My next goal is to add machine learning to this project.
