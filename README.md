# McRaeAlex.github.io

This is my personal website. I have now decided against a theme because
it allows me to show off my skills as a front-end web developer and 
themes never seem to give me exactly what I want.

## To do


- [ ] Fix code snippets, make them scroll on overflow rather than expand the page
- [ ] Find some css that does syntax hightlighting and makes the code examples readable
- [ ] Create a mask that covers the rest of the page when the sidebar opens! Look at the current theme you are using to see how they do it.
- [ ] Make the landing page always be the rest of the view height but crop out the sides on mobile (look at Hanuman for reference)
- [ ] Change the landing page to either my CSS or another image that looks better. (This may invalidate the task above this one)
