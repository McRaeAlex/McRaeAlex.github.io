# McRaeAlex.github.io

This is my personal website. I have now decided against a theme because
it allows me to show off my skills as a front-end web developer and 
themes never seem to give me exactly what I want.

## To do

See project board [here](https://github.com/McRaeAlex/McRaeAlex.github.io/projects/1)

## Start the dev server

Install ruby on your machine with bundler

bundle install

bundle exec jekyll serve
