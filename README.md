# McRaeAlex.github.io

This is my personal website. I have now decided against a theme because
it allows me to show off my skills as a front-end web developer and 
themes never seem to give me exactly what I want.

## To do

- [ ] Make fonts responsive (? i thought browsers set this automatically but apparently not?)
- [x] Make rendering the contact, about, and other pages less of a pain in the ass. (ie. create a new layout that makes the formatting correct)
- [ ] Create or copy a layout for posts that displays blog post correctly (maybe taking someones will be easier, this is the main reason I use themes)
- [ ] Create a mask that covers the rest of the page when the sidebar opens! Look at the current theme you are using to see how they do it.
- [x] Create a footer
- [ ] Make the landing page always be the rest of the view height but crop out the sides on mobile
- [ ] Change the landing page to either my CSS or another image that looks better. (This may invalidate the task above this one)
