Recently I have been wondering about my stuff and if I need any of it really. I believe I have been living with a lot of bloat and I am interested in changing that.

## Clothing

I think one of the big things that I have noticed is my accumulation of clothing. I don't have a ton of clothing I bought but instead a bunch that I have been given. A lot of the clothing comes from events like coding competitions and past rowing regattas. I am going to set myself a goal to over time get down to a certian amount of clothing.

#### End clothing goal

- 8 normal everyday shirts (t-shirts)
- 4 other shirts (henleys, polos, tank tops)
- 5 dress shirts
- 4 pairs of jeans / khakis
- 2 pairs sweatpants
- 3 pairs of non athletic shorts
- 3 sweater
- 2 cardigans
- 3 hoodies (its cold in Canada)
- 1 flannel
- 1 winter jackets
- 1 rain jacket
- 1 suit
- 4 pairs athletic shorts
- 8 athletic shirts

- 1 pair sandles
- 1 pair vans
- 1 pair dress shoes
- 1 pair boots
- 1 pair of glasses

## Electronics

I love programming and electronics in general but after a recent count of all the things I own I realize I hardly use any of it and the stuff I do use I use everyday. A lot of this stuff I needed once
