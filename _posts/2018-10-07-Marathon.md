A marathon is hard, extremely hard, but not nearly as hard as training for a marathon.

I ran this because I felt like pushing myself. I quit rowing in my first year of University and I found it depressing not having anything to release stress. I took up running and said I would finish this marathon no matter what, so I did. I am proud of what I have done but I know I can run it faster and push myself more. I will continue to train and run more and more marathons until I don't want to anymore.
