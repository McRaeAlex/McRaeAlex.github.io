        <h2>Welcome to my website</h2>
        <p>A little bit about me: I am a second year computer science co op student at the University of Victoria. I am
          from Grimsby, Ontario, which is a town near Niagara Falls. In my free time I enjoy running, coding, and
          learning in general. I am currently training for a marathon. My favorite programming language is Rust because
          it confuses me at times and I enjoy that.</p>

          I ran this because I felt like pushing myself. I quit rowing in my first year of University
          and I found it depressing not having anything to release stress. I took up running and said
          I would finish this marathon no matter what, so I did. I am proud of what I have done but I
          know I can run it faster and push myself more. I will continue to train and run more and more
          marathons until I don't want to anymore.<br /><br />

          <b>What I learned:</b> Marathons are hard but fun. Mentally challanging for sure but doable<br /><br />

          <b>Future plans:</b> Run hard and keep going.</p>

          Rusty Snake is a battle snake server written in rust. It uses rocket as its http framework and Serde to
          serialize and deserialize json. I created Rusty out of curiosity, being someone who only knew
          Java in high school and python the summer before University I didn't understand what happened at a lower
          level.
          This is why I choose to pick up rust. Rust made me realize how much high level languages like python and java
          abstract for you. Another benefit from rust was that its fast, this I believe opens up a bunch of
          options on the things I can do with this snake. At the current time I am planning to add machine learning,
          but due to the faster speeds I could run complex algorithms like a* in a fraction of the time compared to my
          past snakes and possibly run multiple algorithms and compare results.<br /><br />
          <b>Why:</b> I wanted to learn rust and I
          needed a battle snake for next year<br /><br />

          <b>What I learned:</b> I learned rust and rocket as well as a lot of lower level stuff like the difficulties
          of
          memory management, the stack vs the heap and pointers.<br /><br />

          <b>Future plans:</b> My next goal is to add machine learning to this project. </p>

          This project was about learning about how social media site, or any site that allows logins in work.
          I wrote this project in Golang which was new to me and my reason was because I wanted to learn a popular
          language.
          Rust is fun to me but employers don't seem to be looking for rust. I found golang to be very easy to work
          with
          although talking to a database was odd.
          <br /><br />
          <b>Why:</b> I wanted to understand how large web app function (cookies, session, password hashing, etc..)<br /><br />

          <b>What I learned:</b> I learned about organizing Go code, dealing with cookies, managing databases and
          overall got a better idea of how web apps work.<br /><br />

          <b>Future plans:</b> I don't think I will continue with this project. It was not meant to be useful for
          anyone but myself and it has served its purpose.</p>

          My website is something I keep on updating constantly. Front end development
          is something that I find fun and relaxing and gives me a chance to take a break
          from my other projects. I find I am constantly learning new things in it, and
          with it being a very popular job I find that there are many resources on it.
          This website is what I made in 2 days! I am really excited to update this regularly!
          <br /><br />

          <b>Why:</b> I find it fun and I needed a website<br /><br />

          <b>What I learned:</b> HTML, CSS, JS, React, Redux, JSON, HTTP, Websockets<br /><br />

          <b>Future plans:</b> This website will continue to be updated!</p>
