    <h2>Welcome to my website!</h2>
    <p>
        A little bit about me: I am a second year computer science co op student at the University of Victoria. I am
        from Grimsby, Ontario, which is a town near Niagara Falls. In my free time I enjoy running, coding, and learning
        in general. My favorite programming language is Rust because it confuses
        me at times and I enjoy that. My least favorite programming language is CSS because do you think this background
        animation worked the first 100 times?
